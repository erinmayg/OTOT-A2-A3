## Task A2.1

### Cluster Creation

1. Ensure `kubectl` and `kind` is installed on your machine.

2. To create a cluster, open your terminal, navigate to the root of this project, and run:

   ```bash
   kind create cluster --name kind-1 --config k8s/kind/cluster-config.yaml
   ```

3. Wait a few minutes until the cluster is set up, once it is set up, you will see a confirmation message:

   ```bash
   Creating cluster "kind-1" ...
   ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.25.0) 🖼
   ✓ Preparing nodes 📦 📦 📦 📦
   ✓ Writing configuration 📜
   ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️
   ✓ Installing CNI 🔌
   ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾
   ✓ Joining worker nodes 🚜
   Set kubectl context to "kind-kind-1"
   You can now use your cluster with:

   kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind-1
   ```

4. To ensure that the cluster is created correctly, you can run the following commands:

   ```bash
   # Inspect that the cluster nodes are running on docker
   docker ps -a

   # Inspect the nodes via kubectl
   kubectl get nodes

   # Inspect the cluster-info
   kubectl cluster-info
   ```

   When running the `kubectl cluster-info`, ensure that the control-plane is running on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` and the port matches the `kind-control-plane`'s exposed port.

## Task A2.2

### Deploy Image to DockerHub

1. Sign up for an account at [DockerHub](http://hub.docker.com). Create a public repository.

2. Tag existing image and push to DockerHub

   ```bash
   # Login to docker
   docker login

   # Tag and push to DockerHub
   docker tag <image-name> <docker-username>/<image-name>[:tag]
   docker push <docker-usename>/<image-name>[:tag]
   ```

3. Verify that the repository exists on DockerHub by navigating to `https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/<docker-username>`

### Create Deployment

1. Create a manifest file (`.yaml`) in `k8s/manifests/` and fill the contents with the following:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
   name: backend
   labels:
     app: backend
   spec:
   replicas: 3
   selector:
     matchLabels:
       app: backend
   template:
     metadata:
       labels:
       app: backend
     spec:
       containers:
         - name: backend
           image: <docker-username>/<docker-repo>[:tag]
           ports:
             - name: http
               containerPort: 80
           resources:
             limits:
               cpu: 40m
               memory: 100Mi
   ```

   Do take note of the indentation as `.yaml` files rely on those for parsing information.

   In this case, the `template.spec.containers[0].image` would be `erinmayg/nginx-sample` (the image from A1.2)

2. Run the following command to deploy the Deployment to the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <filepath to yaml>
   ```

   Assuming you are in the root folder of this project, the command you need to run would be:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/manifests/backend-deploy.yaml
   ```

### Create Service

1. Create a manifest file (`.yaml`) in `k8s/manifests/` and fill the contents with the following:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     labels:
       app: backend
       name: backend
     spec:
       selector:
         app: backend
       type: ClusterIP
       ports:
         - name: http
           port: 8080
           protocol: TCP
           targetPort: http
   ```

2. Run the following command to deploy the Deployment to the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <filepath to yaml>
   ```

   Assuming you are in the root folder of this project, the command you need to run would be:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/manifests/backend-service.yaml
   ```

3. Check if the service is running correctly by running:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward service/backend <portNo>:8080
   ```

   You can open `https://localhost:portNo` in your browser, it should display the nginx webpage.

### Create Ingress Controller

1. Ensure all nodes are ingress-enabled

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes -L ingress-ready
   ```

   It should output all the nodes in the cluster (same output as `kubectl get nodes`).

2. Deploy the `nginx-ingress-controller`

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml

   # Check if deployed
   kubectl -n ingress-nginx get deploy -w
   ```

   The `-w` flag stands for `--watch`, once the deployment is `READY` (i.e. `1/1`) you can just stop the command.

### Create Ingress

1. Create a manifest file for the Ingress object in `k8s/manifests/`

   ```yaml
   # backend-ingress.yaml

   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: backend
     labels:
       app: backend
     annotations:
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
   spec:
     rules:
       - http:
           paths:
             - path: /app
               pathType: Prefix
               backend:
                 service:
                   name: backend
                   port:
                     name: http
   ```

2. Deploy the Ingress to the cluster

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/manifests/backend-ingress.yaml
   ```

3. Check if Ingress is deployed

   ```bash
   kubectl get ingress
   ```

   It should output

   ```bash
   NAME      CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS     PORTS   AGE
   backend   <none>   *       localhost   80      112m
   ```

4. Check if Ingress is running correctly by opening <https://localhost:80/app> in your browser. It should display the nginx webpage.
